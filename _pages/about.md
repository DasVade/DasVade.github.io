I am an undergraduate student in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM) at the University of Pennsylvania.  
I am currently working on robotics and control systems, focusing on dynamic modeling, optimal control, and simulation-based methods for motion planning.  
Previously, I interned at United Automotive Electronic Systems (UAES) in Shanghai, where I worked on power electronics manufacturing and digital twin optimization.  
I have also worked on several projects involving manipulator dynamics, servo control, and quadrotor trajectory optimization under the MEAM curriculum at Penn.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning.  
I am broadly interested in how model-based and data-driven methods can be integrated to enable intelligent and physically grounded robotic systems.
