I am a senior in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics (MEAM) at the University of Pennsylvania.  

I am currently working on learning-based simulation with a focus on connecting physical modeling and data-driven methods for motion and control. Previously, I worked on robot control and dynamics projects at the University of Pennsylvania, including manipulator modeling, servo design, and quadrotor trajectory optimization.
Earlier, during my studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I developed robotic simulation systems and explored dynamics-based control methods.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control, and machine learning, emphasizing dynamic modeling, optimal control, and physics-informed neural simulation.
