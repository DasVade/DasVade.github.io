Previously, I worked on robot control and dynamics projects at the University of Pennsylvania, including manipulator modeling, servo design, and quadrotor trajectory optimization. Earlier, during my studies at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I developed robotic simulation systems and explored dynamics-based control methods.</p> <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control, and machine learning, emphasizing dynamic modeling, optimal control, and physics-informed neural simulation.</p> <hr> <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2> <div class="col"> <a href=""> <div class="card h-100 hoverable"> <div class="card-body"> <h2 class="card-title"></h2> <p class="card-text"></p> <div class="row ml-1 mr-1 p-0"> </div> </div> </div> </a> </div> <p><a href="/projects">See all projects →</a></p> <hr> <h2 id="awards">Awards</h2> <ul> <li> <p>Exchange Scholarship (Tuition Waived)<br> <em>SJTU–Penn 3+1+1 Joint Program</em>, 2025</p> </li> <li> <p>Outstanding Course Project Award<br> <em>SJTU ME3220: Design and Manufacture II</em>, 2024</p> </li> </ul> </body></html>
